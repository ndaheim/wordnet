## This project contains functionality to handle wordnets.

Currently this is just a fun project of mine. It assumes a Wordnet format as in the Odenet, which can be found [here](https://github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet) and provides a german wordnet. The current functionality can be used to find words sharing common lemmas and, thus, concepts and to retrieve synonyms.However, it is agnostic of the intended word sense and will retrieve synonyms for different contexts. The search can furthermore be narrowed down based on Part-of-Speech tags.
